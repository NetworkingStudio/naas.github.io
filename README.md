An investigation into Kerberos 
Software Name: Network Authentication Application System (NAAS) authentication protocol is to support network management, network administrators and software engineers community.

### Project Description
An investigation into Kerberos. Where executing Kerberos as secure mechanism in user’s centralised cloud network security management, a network security using Kerberos authentication protocol for multiple user application, in a virtual environment. The authentication implementation is by introducing CentOS-7 version, with Open-LDAP, to supports security authentication which keeps all user account information in a single setting, a virtual software environment that support NFS-(autofs) for the distribution of data across the networks, with an auto-mount facility for users, automatically mounting filesystem directories, which is designed to address the modern way to mount directories over a network.

### Abstract 

The purpose of this final year project is to investigation on Kerberos authentication protocol and demonstrate the use of Kerberos v5 as a secure mechanism for a collective, and centralised single-sign-on authentication protocol settings, in a secured network management environment, implementing this technique is to enhance network security structures in a cloud network management. Optimisation, vulnerability, threats, and attacks has known respect for internet users.  

The most important in today’s internet of things (IoT) technology is security, we are often scared using our private and personal credentials (data) over the internet, which can also be very dangerous, however, this is not to scare you, but to give you an insider solution to fast growing technology threats, you may find very useful and important, as network administrator or software engineers. 
A significant increase in network threats, and the increase in network security authentication defence, is the capability to achieve a single-sign-on secured environment, in this final year project, following the secure process to uncover ways network users addresses threats when implementing network security within an organisation. NAAS (Network Authentication Application System: is a realm name NAAS.KVM used in this project), with the combination of Kerberos authentication. The solution that lets users authenticate themselves just once, to have access information to many system, which also include the following protocols, such as authorization service, the generic security service (GSS-API), to establish secured context for communicating with server/client a peer application, also the use of SSH-edited-config and SSHD-config to enable the user for open-ldap, furthermore, the authentication method is by introducing CentOS-7 version, with Open-LDAP mechanism that supports security, which keeps all user account information in a single setting, a virtual software environment that support NFS-service-(autofs) for the distribution of data across the networks, with an auto-mount facility that stores the auto-mode for users, automatically mounting filesystem directories, the Kerberos v5, is used as underlying security mechanism for the NAAS single-sign-on for multiple user application.
